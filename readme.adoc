== About

This project contains a collection of schemas for Distributed Acoustic Sensing.
The schemas are used in the communication process between a data producer (DAS interrogator) and a data processing
server (DAS processor).

=== Description for use of schemas

The DASAcquisition schema is used when communicating a new DAS acquisition.
The fields in the schema should adhere to the 2.0 ProdML standard: http://w3.energistics.org/energyML/data/prodml/v2.0/doc/prodml_schema_overview.html

The DASMeasurement and the DASMeasurementKey are used for streaming time based messages, where each message contains raw amplitudes
either as an array of floats or as an array of integers.

TODO: Details about handshake process.
